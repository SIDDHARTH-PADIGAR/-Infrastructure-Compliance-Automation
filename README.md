## Key Goals:

- **S3 Bucket Encryption**: This component ensures that all S3 buckets are configured with server-side encryption using the AES256 algorithm. Encryption protects data at rest, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring data confidentiality.

- **Security Group Configuration**: The project includes the creation and management of security groups with carefully defined rules. This involves:
  - **Restricted SSH Access**: Configuring security group rules to limit SSH access to specific IP addresses, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
  - **Controlled Outbound Traffic**: Setting up rules to allow or restrict outbound traffic, ensuring that only necessary communications are permitted.

By implementing these compliance rules, the project helps to automate the enforcement of security best practices and regulatory requirements, reducing manual configuration errors and improving overall infrastructure security.
